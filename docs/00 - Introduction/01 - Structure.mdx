There's no structure for where you have to put your assets and pages &mdash; put them wherever makes sense for your project.

Super SSG exposes a few HTML element equivalents (see the sections under components). When passing in a `src` or `href` to these components, always use a shash (`/`) followed the relative path from the project root. E.g. with the structure,

```
My Project
/ assets
  / my-image.png
/ pages
  / other.mdx
  / index.mdx
```

Your `index.mdx` may look like this,

```
[Markdown links work too](/pages/other.mdx)
```

Or you may have JavaScript files like this,

```js
import { A, Image } from "super-ssg";

<A href="/pages/other.mdx">Other</A>
<Image src="/assets/my-image.png" />;
```

Assets are optimised and output to `/site/res` with a hashed filename. This means it's possible to set a long cache policy on all assets under `/res`.
