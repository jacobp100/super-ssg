The `Image` component optimises and converts images to `WebP`.. Takes a `src` prop as defined in the [assets structure section](</docs/00 - Introduction/01 - Structure.mdx>), and renders a backwards-compatible [`picture` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture).

```js
import { Image } from "super-ssg";

<Image src="/path/to/your/image.png" />;
```

```html
<picture>
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/res/image.webp" />
  <img src="/res/image.png" />
</picture>
```

AVIF is implemented but not enabled, as it currently takes too long to encode.

Conversion to other image formats is only done on production builds. If you see an image without any other image formats, it's because the non-converted format had a smaller filesize. In this case, you'll only see an `img` element (unless other sources were provided).

## Sources

Additional image sources can be provided using the `ImageSource` element. All optimisation and convertions are still performed for each source. Takes a `srcSet`, the same as `src` for the `Image` component.

```js
import { Image, ImageSource } from "super-ssg";

<Image src="/desktop.png">
  <ImageSource srcSet="/mobile.png" media="(min-width: 800px)" />
</Image>;
```

```html
<picture>
  <source
    type="image/webp"
    srcset="/res/mobile.webp"
    media="(min-width: 800px)"
  />
  <source srcset="/res/mobile.png" media="(min-width: 800px)" />
  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/res/desktop.webp" />
  <img src="/res/desktop.png" />
</picture>
```

## Sizes

You can automatically set the `width` and `height` attributes on an image to their pixel values by setting the respective props to `auto`. This works in `ImageSource`s too. If the image is resized, the values are of the final image size.

```js
<Image src="/image.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
```

```html
<img src="/res/image.png" width="100" height="100" />
```

## Resizing

You can resize and crop images using the `resize` prop.

- `"100w"`: resize to 100px wide, maintaining aspect ratio
- `"100h"`: resize to 100px tall, maintaining aspect ratio
- `"100x200"`: resize to 100px wide, 200px tall
- Object: see [sharp's resize options](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize)

```js
<Image src="/image.png" resize="100w" />
```
