Utility component to load a video, and have it output to the `/res` folder. Does not optimise the video, as it's too expensive. Takes a `src` prop as defined in the [assets structure section](</docs/00 - Introduction/01 - Structure.mdx>).

```js
import { Video } from "super-ssg";

<Video src="/path/to/your.mp4" type="video/mp4" />;
```

```html
<video>
  <source src="/res/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```
