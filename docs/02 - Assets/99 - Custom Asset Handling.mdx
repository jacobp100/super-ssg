Almost all asset transforms consist of a transform function, a content object to read and write assets, then a React hook to get the content object. Most transform functions take in a url, read the contents of the file, transform it, then save the contents of the file &mdash; returning the url where it was saved to.

For example, a CSS transform may look like this.

```js
import { assetTransform, useContent } from "super-ssg";

const transformCss = assetTransform(async (content, href) => {
  let cssString = content.read(href);

  // E.g. cssString = someOptimiser(cssString)

  const href = content.write(cssString, { extension: ".css" });
  return href;
});

const ExternalCss = (props) => {
  const content = useContent();
  const href = transformCss(content, props.href);
  return <link href={href} rel="stylesheet" />;
};
```

This might seem like extra code, but it also achieves a few things:

- It lets the page track which assets are used, so will automatically rebuild when any are changed
- The results are cached

Some important points when using transforms:

- Asset transforms must take `content` as the first parameter, then the remaining parameters **must** be JSON serializable
- The transform function can be async &mdash; although it doesn't have to be
- You can return any data, including non-serializable data

There's a few cases where the development server restarts its node instance &mdash; such as when a JS file changes. In this case, the transform cache would normally be cleared, and all transforms must be recomputed after it restarts. For transforms with simple, serializable return values (e.g. returning a url &mdash; like above), we extract the cache before the node instance restarts, then restore it once it's back up. If you want to opt into this behaviour &mdash; and your return value is serializable &mdash; you can add a second argument `{ cacheKey: 'some-unique-string' }`.

## Built-in Transforms

The following are exported so you can do your own pre-processing steps without losing the built-in functionality.

```js
import {
  transformCss,
  transformHtml,
  transformJs,
  transformSvg,
} from "super-ssg";
```

For example, you could make a component to do your own CSS handling.

```js
import postcss from "postcss";
import spiffing from "postcss-spiffing";
import { assetTransform, useContent } from "super-ssg";

const transformCustomCss = assetTransform(async (content, href) => {
  let css = content.read(href);
  css = (await postcss.process([spiffing()]).process(css, { from: href })).css;
  css = await transformCss(content, css);

  const href = content.write(css, { extension: ".css" });
  return href;
});

const CustomCss = (props) => {
  const content = useContent();
  const href = transformCustomCss(content, props.href);
  return <link href={href} rel="stylesheet" />;
};
```

There is currently no way to customise the handling MDX files.
